# Personal Budget
## A Codecademy project

For this project, you will build an API that allows clients to create and manage a personal budget. Using Envelope Budgeting principles, your API should allow users to manage budget envelopes and track the balance of each envelope. Your API should follow best practices regarding REST endpoint naming conventions, proper response codes, etc. Make sure to include data validation to ensure users do not overspend their budget!

## Project Objectives:
- Build an API using Node.js and Express
- Be able to create, read, update, and delete envelopes
- Create endpoint(s) to update envelope balances
- Use Git version control to keep track of your work
- Use the command line to navigate your files and folders
- Use Postman to test API endpoints
## Prerequisites:
- Command line and file navigation
- Javascript
- Node.js
- Express
- Git and GitHub
- Postman

# Personal Budget, part II

In this project, you will extend the Personal Budget API created in Personal Budget, Part I. In the first Budget API, we did not have a way to persist data on the server. Now, we are going to build out a persistence layer (aka a database or DB) to keep track of the budget envelopes and their balances. You will need to plan out your database design, then use PostgreSQL to create the necessary tables. Once your database is set up, connect your API calls to a database. Once youâ€™ve added and connected your database, you will add a new feature to your server that allows users to enter transactions. This feature will put your envelope system into action! Finally, you will make your API available for others to use by documenting it with Swagger and deploying it with Heroku.

## Project Objectives:
- Use Git version control
- Create documentation using the Swagger API
- Implement a database
- Integrate existing API endpoints with database layer
- Database implementation for transactions
- Deploy app using Heroku

## Prerequisites:
- Command line and file navigation
- Git and GitHub
- Javascript
- Node.js/Express
- Postman
- PostgreSQL
- Database relationships and configuration
- Sequelize
- Heroku
